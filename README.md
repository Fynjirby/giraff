A small pack of prebuilt css styles that makes website look old and cool at the same time :)

## How to use

put this in `<head>` of your website's page

### 1st way - import it from website (slow, loads everytime)

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fynjirby/giraff@main/src/main.css">
```

### 2nd way - download it and put to your website folder

just download repo and import `src/main.css`

## To see how it looks now checkout examples folder in repo file tree

#### not all elements are styled for now!
